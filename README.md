## Conventional-Helicopter-Controller
Control of a conventional Helicopter configuration model using Feedback Linearization and Integral Backstepping control.


## How to run
### Run code
1) Open FullHelicopterSimulatorFeatheringAeroLiftQUAT_SO4_staySmoke.pde
2) Run the simulatino with the "play" button on upper left corner of the screen.
3) Before running the simulatgion, set the desired tracking altitude "REFALT" for the chopper to track. 
4) Press in the following sequence, 'g', 'h', 'j'. To turn on the controol logic of the chopper
    (Note: The Chopper will self right in the air andd come to a stable orientation.)
5) Once the chopper is stable, you can command new altitudes or inertial "x" or "y" coordinates to track to.
    ( Note: This simulation does alot of math, for faster view of the simulation, I reccomend running on desktop computer.
            snd closing other apps you are not using.)
